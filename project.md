Hi Professor ,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Zhiqing Pan](https://pzq123456.github.io/), and I am writing to formally express my interest in working on a project (LSGI552) under your supervision. 

Regarding the project, I currently don't have a specific topic in mind. I would appreciate the opportunity to contribute to a group endeavour and be involved in one of its ongoing tasks.

Please find my attached resume for further details. 

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Zhiqing Pan
